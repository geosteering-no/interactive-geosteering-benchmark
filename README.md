# Interactive Sequential-decision Geosteering Benchmark
Also known as **NORCE Geosteering Game 2019** and **Project Geobanana**

## Contents
Server/Client for Geosteering Competition Platform

### Server
Dotnet Core 3.0 Kestrel Server

TODO: review the server instructions

#### Requires:
* Asp.NetCore 3.0
  * Which requires Visual Studio 2019 or MSBuild 16(??)

#### Server Overview
1.	Cookie-based identification
2.	JSON-based get/post requests (send angle, and timestamp*, get points 4*80*100)
3.	Get again request
4.	Same data twice does not change anything
5.	AJAX request solves everything
6.	Logging all on backend 

#### Publishing server
This may require building in release first?
1. Navigate to folder which contains GameServer.csproj
2. Run the command `dotnet publish -c Release -r <target-os> --self-contained true`
   * For 64 bit windows 10: \<target-os> = win10-x64
   * Run command:  `dotnet publish -c Release -r win10-x64 --self-contained true`
3. The self-contained folder should now be located at GameServer/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.0/\<target-os>/

### Client
Written in javascript using the [p5](https://p5js.org/) client-side library

## Citing and details: 

The repository contains the results of two software projects:
1. Web-based Interactive Sequential-decision Geosteering Platform and Benchmark
2. Back-end system that represents and reduces uncertainties using Ensemble Kalman Filter paired with fully automated Decision Support System

Below are details of two papers describing these components:
