# Interactive Sequential-decision Geosteering Benchmark
Also known as **NORCE Geosteering Game 2019** or **Project Geobanana**

## Contents
 1. **Server**
 2. **Client**
 3. **Ensemble-Based Decision Support System**

for **Interactive Sequential-decision Geosteering Benchmark Platform**

### 1. Server
The server project is located in the folder [/server/GameServer2](/server/GameServer2).

Server description and features:
1. Dotnet Kestrel Server
2.	Cookie-based identification
3.	JSON-based get/post requests (including send angle and timestamp, get points 4*80*100)
4.	Get-again request
5.	The same data twice does not change anything
6.	Logging all user actions on the backend

The folder [/server/ServerObjectives2](/server/ServerObjectives2) contains the implementation of objective functions used for the benchmark; see [Alyaev et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acags.2021.100072) cited below.

### 2. Client
The client web files are served by the Server and are located in the folder [/server/GameServer2/wwwroot](/server/GameServer2/wwwroot).

Client description and features:
1. Written in javascript using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) client-side library
2. Visualization of uncertainty
3. Visualization of the tool's depth of detection
4. Ability to evaluate the objective function within the predicted uncertainty

### 3. Ensemble-Based Decision Support System
Ensemble-Based Decision Support System components (and corresponding project folders):
1. Custom multi-layer toy geomodel and a simplified electromagnetic sensing tool ([/server/ResistivitySimulator](/server/ResistivitySimulator))
2. Ensemble Kalman Filter implementation (in C#) to reduce uncertainty ([/server/EnKFLib2](/server/EnKFLib2))
3. Novel automated decision-support-system (DSS) bot with discrete dynamic programming for global and robust optimization under uncertainty ([/server/TrajectoryOptimization](/server/TrajectoryOptimization))

The default DSS is integrated into the backend, but third-party bots are supported via REST API.

Other directories contain utility libraries. 

## Installation and execution

### Requirements
The current solution and project files are configured for **.NET Core Runtime 8.0**
Download instructions

### Building (Publishing) Server
This may require building in release first?
1. Navigate to folder which contains GameServer.csproj
2. Run the command `dotnet publish -c Release -r <target-os> --self-contained true`
   * For 64 bit windows 10: \<target-os> = win10-x64
   * Run command:  `dotnet publish -c Release -r win10-x64 --self-contained true`
3. The self-contained folder should now be located at GameServer/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.0/\<target-os>/

### Running server

#### Windows
#### Mac-OS (arm-64)
#### Linux

### Debugging and developing

MS VS


## Citing and details: 

The repository contains the results of two software projects:
1. Web-based Interactive Sequential-decision Geosteering Platform and Benchmark
2. Back-end system that represents and reduces uncertainties using Ensemble Kalman Filter paired with fully automated Decision Support System

Below are details of two papers describing these components:
