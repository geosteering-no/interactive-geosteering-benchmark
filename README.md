# Interactive Sequential-decision Geosteering Benchmark
Also known as **NORCE Geosteering Game 2019** or **Project Geobanana**

## Contents
 - Server,
 - Client, and
 - Ensemble-Based Decision Support System
for **Interactive Sequential-decision Geosteering Benchmark Platform**

### Server
1. Dotnet Kestrel Server
2.	Cookie-based identification
3.	JSON-based get/post requests (including send angle and timestamp, get points 4*80*100)
4.	Get-again request
5.	The same data twice does not change anything
6.	Logging all user actions on the backend 

### Client
1. Written in javascript using the [p5](https://p5js.org/) client-side library
2. Visualization of uncertainty
3. Visualization of the tool's depth of detection
4. Ability to evaluate the objective function within the predicted uncertainty

### Ensemble-Based Decision Support System
1. Custom multi-layer toy geomodel and a simplified electromagnetic sensing tool 
2. Ensemble Kalman Filter implementation (in C#) to reduce uncertainty
3. Novel automated decision-support-system (DSS) bot with discrete dynamic programming for global and robust optimization under uncertainty
The default DSS is integrated into the backend, but third-party bots are supported via REST API.

## Instalation

### Requirements
The current solution and project files are configure for **.NET Core Runtime 8.0**

#### Publishing server
This may require building in release first?
1. Navigate to folder which contains GameServer.csproj
2. Run the command `dotnet publish -c Release -r <target-os> --self-contained true`
   * For 64 bit windows 10: \<target-os> = win10-x64
   * Run command:  `dotnet publish -c Release -r win10-x64 --self-contained true`
3. The self-contained folder should now be located at GameServer/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.0/\<target-os>/

4. 
## Citing and details: 

The repository contains the results of two software projects:
1. Web-based Interactive Sequential-decision Geosteering Platform and Benchmark
2. Back-end system that represents and reduces uncertainties using Ensemble Kalman Filter paired with fully automated Decision Support System

Below are details of two papers describing these components:
